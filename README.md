## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

- It is possible to achieve accent color effect using ``` box-shadow: inset ``` property since it's more widely supported than ``` accent-color ```
- When ```display:flex``` is used for ```ul``` element with its ```list-style-type``` set to ```none```, it does not center ```li``` elements properly using ```justify-content```.
- If you don't specify a ```height``` property for the parent element of an element which is set to ```display: flex``` it does not vertically align its child no matter you set it to ```justify-content: center``` or ```align-items: center```
- ```background-blend-mode``` property is used to blend background image with background color creating accent-color effect mentioned above.
