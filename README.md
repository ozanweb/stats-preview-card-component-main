## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

- It is possible to achieve accent color effect using ``` box-shadow: inset ``` property since it's more widely supported than ``` accent-color ```
- When ```display:flex``` is used for ```ul``` element with its ```list-style-type``` set to ```none```, it does not center ```li``` elements properly using ```justify-content```.
- If you don't specify a ```height``` property for the parent element of an element which is set to ```display: flex``` it does not vertically align its child no matter you set it to ```justify-content: center``` or ```align-items: center```
- ```background-blend-mode``` property is used to blend background image with background color creating accent-color effect mentioned above.
